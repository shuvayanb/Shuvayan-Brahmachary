title: About
---

I am a postdoctoral research fellow working in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), Japan, under the mentorship of [Dr. Hideaki Ogawa](http://aero.kyushu-u.ac.jp/stsel/about.html) since Sept. 2019. I have obtained my Ph.D from [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the guidance of [Dr. Ganesh Natarajan](https://sites.google.com/site/ganucfd/) and [Prof. Niranjan Sahoo](https://iitg.irins.org/profile/128417). My Ph.D <a href="Thesis_short_version.pdf" target="_blank">thesis.</a> title is "Finite Volume/Immersed Boundary Solvers for Compressible Flows: Development and Applications". 

My research experience and interest include development of novel algorithms aimed at the accurate numerical simulation of high-speed compressible using non-conformal flow solvers, aerodynamic design and optimisation, as well as the use of machine learning to learn fluid flow pattern (requires the use of reduced order modelling approaches like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition). 

I am an avid Chelsea FC fan since 2002, occasional reader/runner and mindfulness practitioner.
