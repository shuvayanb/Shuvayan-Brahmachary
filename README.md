## Welcome to my website

### About me

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), Japan, working under the mentorship of [Dr. Hideaki Ogawa](https://kyushu-u.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/hideaki-ogawa). I have obtained my Ph.D from [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the guidance of [Dr. Ganesh Natarajan](https://sites.google.com/site/ganucfd/) and [Prof. Niranjan Sahoo](http://www.iitg.ac.in/mech/files/faculty_CV/Website-CV-NS.pdf). My Ph.D thesis title is "Finite Volume/Immersed Boundary Solvers for Compressible Flows: Development and Applications". My research experience and goals primarily includes algorithm development, numerical simulations of fluid flows in compressible regime and its application towards design and optimization of various configurations.
