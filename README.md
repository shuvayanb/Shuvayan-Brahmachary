### About me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), Japan, working under the mentorship of [Dr. Hideaki Ogawa](http://aero.kyushu-u.ac.jp/stsel/about.html) since Sept. 2019. I have obtained my Ph.D from [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the guidance of [Dr. Ganesh Natarajan](https://sites.google.com/site/ganucfd/) and [Prof. Niranjan Sahoo](https://iitg.irins.org/profile/128417). My Ph.D <a href="Thesis_short_version.pdf" target="_blank">thesis.</a> title is "Finite Volume/Immersed Boundary Solvers for Compressible Flows: Development and Applications". My research experience and goals primarily includes algorithm development, numerical simulations of fluid flows in compressible regime and its application towards design and optimization of various configurations.
